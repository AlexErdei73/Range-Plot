## Range Plot
The below Java program calculates the range of a projectile without air resistance then it makes a plot about the range 
as a function of the angle of the angle of ejection. The project is in the [Physics Simulations](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/javamanual.pdf)
manual. The initial speed is given as a parameter. The code uses the [Plot.java](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/javacourse/Plot.java.txt)
class, which has been made by [Daniel V. Shroeder](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/).
